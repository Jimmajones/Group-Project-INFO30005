		<h2>What is diabetes?</h2>
		<p>Diabetes mellitus, commonly referred to more simply as diabetes, is a group of health conditions that result in high blood glucose levels.</p>

		<h2>Too much of a good thing? Yes, it turns out</h2>
		<p>Glucose is a simple sugar and the number one energy source in all living things. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, controls the amount of glucose within the bloodstream and helps store it. When there's either not enough insulin or cells do not react to insulin properly, glucose builds up within the blood and causes damage to parts of the body.</p>
		
		<h2>What types of diabetes are there?</h2>
		<p>There are multiple types of diabetes, characterized by their causes. The most common types are the following:</p>
		
		<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
		<p>Type 1 diabetes is caused by an autoimmune response wherein insulin-producing cells within the pancreas are destroyed. The cause of this autoimmune response is currently unknown, but there is a strong hereditary risk.</p>
		
		<h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
		<p>Type 2 diabetes is most commonly caused by a combination of excess body weight and a lack of exercise, resulting in increased insulin resistance within the body.</p>
		
		<h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
		<p>Gestational diabetes refers to heightened blood glucose levels during pregnancy, caused by increased insulin resistance due to hormonal changes.</p>
		
		<h2>Not all hope is lost!</h2>
		<p>While some forms of diabetes are not preventable and there is no known cure, it is fortunately easily manageable through lifestyle changes and medicine (usually insulin replacement).</p>
