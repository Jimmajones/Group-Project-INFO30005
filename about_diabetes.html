		<p>There are multiple types of diabetes with different causes. The most common types are the following:</p>
		
		<h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
		<p>Type 1 diabetes is caused by the pancreas being unable to produce enough insulin due to an autoimmune condition.</p>
		
		<h3>Type 2 diabetes</h3>
		<p>Type 2 diabetes is onset with an increased resistance to insulin. It is most commonly caused by excessive body weight and a lack of exercise.</p>
		
		<h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
